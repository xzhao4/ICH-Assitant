    "                        Epidural hematomas are usually caused by trauma.\n",
    "                        Subdural hematomas are predominantly the result of trauma.\n",
    "                        Isolated subarachnoid hemorrhage, without other types of cerebral hemorrhage, is likely due to an aneurysm.\n",
    "                        \n",
